# Collaborative Filtering
Finished notebook: [Movie Ratings](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chen10an/ml_algos_python/blob/master/collaborative_filtering/Collaborative%20Filtering%20for%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb)

This notebook's implementation of collaborative filtering is based on Andrew Ng's
lectures and assignments from [Coursera][coursera]. In addition to the notebook,
I've created three python files (main.py, user.py, utils.py) to make it possible
to run the algorithm as a script (main.py).
